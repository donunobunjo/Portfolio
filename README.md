## ðŸ§­ My Story

I am a **Data Analyst** and **Machine Learning Engineer** who transforms raw data into intelligence and insight. My passion lies at the intersection of logic and creativity â€” building models that not only predict outcomes but tell meaningful stories.

With expertise in **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and tools like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **TensorFlow**, I design solutions that turn data-driven challenges into strategic opportunities. My projects span from **customer segmentation** and **predictive analytics** to **interactive dashboards** and **business intelligence systems**.

Beyond technical skill, I bring clarity, curiosity, and commitment â€” ensuring every solution I build delivers measurable impact. Whether collaborating with teams or working independently, I aim to bridge the gap between code and purpose, data and decision.

To me, data is more than numbers â€” itâ€™s imagination waiting to become intelligence.

| **Title** | **Overview** | **Objectives** | **Deployed** | **Repo** | **Read More** |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Customer segmentation and spending behavior analysis** | This project analyzes customer demographics and spending behavior using a dataset containing information about **customers**. Through a blend of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data visualization**, and **machine learning**, this project highlights how factors like income, age, and gender influence spending behavior - and how customers can be grouped into actionable market segments. | The primary aim is to discover spending trends, identify customer segments, and develop predictive models that help businesses better understand and target thier customers. | [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p6PbT_motxX2A-AX1AlUQ-GJ7Uo7wJqD?usp=sharing) |  [GitHub](https://github.com/donunobunjo/customer_analysis_prediction_and_segmentation.git) |
| **Credit default analysis and prediction** | This project analyzes and predicts **loan default risk**.  | Identifies key financial and demographic risk factors for credit default. Builds predictive models to classify applicants as *low risk* or *high risk*. Providing insights to support better lending decisions| [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NiMOEX1F6q0qwBETuZ4bXSE_YChkaeiU?usp=sharing) | [GitHub](https://github.com/donunobunjo/credit_default_analysis_and_prediction.git)  |
| **S & P Global** | This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **S&P Global** stock market dataset. The analysis aims to uncover key insights about stock price movements, trading activity, and volatility patterns over . The dataset provides us with historical stock prices(5 years: 2013 - 2018) for companies found on the S & P 500 index | Study market dynamics and identify the top-performing and underperforming stocks. Create visualizations to aid investment decision-making. Derive 50-day and 200-day moving averages, what long-term vs short-term patterns emerge from the moving average. What is the magnitude od daily price fluctuations for each stock? | [Power BI  DashBoard](https://github.com/donunobunjo/S-P-Global-Dashboard/blob/main/S%26P%20Dashboard.pbix) <br><br><br> [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uUJposnYRNePLbrhdLr4_TI5gkEqiHJl?usp=sharing) | [GitHub](https://github.com/donunobunjo/S-P-Global.git)  |
